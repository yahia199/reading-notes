## Terminal
1. Command line

*A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.*

- Shortcuts:

*You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys.You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.*

2. Basic Navigation
 *We have many commands *
 -  Print Working Directory(PWD): This command use to know Where are we.

 -  list(ls): is a little more powerful. We have run it here with no arguments in which case it will just do a plain listing of our current location.

 - Paths : is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system. There is two type of paths:


 1. Absolute paths:  specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / ) .

 2. Relative paths:  specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.

 - change directory(cd) : it use to open a directory and we can go back by use cd without arguments .


 3. More About Files
 **Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them. SO to avoid this problem we can using quotes around the entire item.**

 4. Manual Pages : The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do.

*What are they?*

- man command

*Look up the manual page for a particular command.*

- man -k search term

*Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.*

- /term

*Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'*

- n

*After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.*

5. File Manipulation
*In this fike we learn how to use mkdir which it short for Make Directory and we use touch to Creating a Blank File, we use cp to copy a directory and file , we use mv to Moving a File or Directory and we use -r for Removing non empty Directories *
