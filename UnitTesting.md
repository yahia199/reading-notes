## Unit Testing

---

unit testing : is testing of procedures or methods that a source module makes available to the rest of an application. A “unit” can be anything from a single procedure to an entire library. The essential point of unit testing is that you test only a small part of the application.
---

The easiest way to test a unit is to write a small application,For example our reverse array method in lab1 we create a test method to check 
the result is a reversed array as we expected.

Why do we need Unit test?

1. Unit testing always has the ability to find problems in early stages in the development cycle.
2. Codes are more reusable, reliable and clean.
3. Development becomes faster.
4. Easy to automate.
