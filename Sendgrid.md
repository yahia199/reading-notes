## Two-factor authentication
Twilio SendGrid uses Two-factor authentication (2FA) to help protect your account. To enable 2FA, Navigate to Two-Factor Authentication in the Twilio SendGrid Settings menu, and click Add Two-Factor Authentication.

The Twilio SendGrid App's Two-factor authentication menu
A modal will open where you can complete the 2FA setup. Click Ok, Got it to continue.

If you have previously configured services to authenticate with Twilio SendGrid APIs using Basic Authentication, enabling 2FA will break those integrations. You must use API keys to authenticate with Twilio SendGrid APIs.

A modal asking to confirm 2FA setup
Twilio SendGrid supports 2FA using either SMS or the Authy App. Select your preferred 2FA method, and click Next.

You will need to enter a phone number to complete the 2FA process. SMS users will be sent a confirmation code at the number they entered. Authy users will be sent instructions for downloading and completing the 2FA setup using the Authy app.

## API keys
API Keys authenticate your application, mail client, or website with Twilio SendGrid services. Unlike a username and password, API keys are scoped to provide access only to the services you select. You can also delete and create API keys without impacting your other account credentials. For these reasons, Twilio SendGrid requires you to connect to its services using API keys.

Create an API key
In the Twilio SendGrid App, navigate to API Keys in the Settings menu, and select Create API Key.

A modal will open where you can create your key. You must name the API key â€” we recommend something that will clearly differentiate the key from others you may create in the future.

A modal where you can name configure and configure an API key
You must also select the type of key you want to create. Twilio SendGrid provides three types of API key:

- Full Access
- Restricted Access
- Billing Access
To keep your account secure, you should give each key the least privilege necessary. You can limit a key's capabilities by creating a Restricted Access key and selecting a subset of all the possible permissions.
