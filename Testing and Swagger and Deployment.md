# Testing and Swagger and Deployment

Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code. Its main goals are to:

- Minimize the amount of work needed to connect decoupled services.
- Reduce the amount of time needed to accurately document a service.

## OpenApi vs. Swagger

The Swagger project was donated to the OpenAPI Initiative in 2015 and has since been referred to as OpenAPI. Both names are used interchangeably. However, "OpenAPI" refers to the specification. "Swagger" refers to the family of open-source and commercial products from SmartBear that work with the OpenAPI Specification. Subsequent open-source products, such as OpenAPIGenerator, also fall under the Swagger family name, despite not being released by SmartBear.

In short:

- OpenAPI is a specification.
- Swagger is tooling that uses the OpenAPI specification. For example, OpenAPIGenerator and SwaggerUI.

## OpenAPI specification (openapi.json)

The OpenAPI specification is a document that describes the capabilities of your API. The document is based on the XML and attribute annotations within the controllers and models. It's the core part of the OpenAPI flow and is used to drive tooling such as SwaggerUI. By default, it's named openapi.json.

## Unit tests of controller logic

Unit tests involve testing a part of an app in isolation from its infrastructure and dependencies. When unit testing controller logic, only the contents of a single action are tested, not the behavior of its dependencies or of the framework itself.

Set up unit tests of controller actions to focus on the controller's behavior. A controller unit test avoids scenarios such as filters, routing, and model binding. Tests that cover the interactions among components that collectively respond to a request are handled by integration tests. For more information on integration tests, see Integration tests in ASP.NET Core.

If you're writing custom filters and routes, unit test them in isolation, not as part of tests on a particular controller action.
