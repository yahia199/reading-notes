# Mindsets

Your mindset is a set of beliefs that shape how you make sense of the world and yourself. It influences how you think, feel, and behave in any given situation.

### How to think like a programmer 

1. Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them.

2. Plan

Don’t dive right into solving without a plan.

3. Divide

Do not try to solve one big problem, Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

- Practice
Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!
